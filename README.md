Running Leap Locally
===
Leap uses Jekyll for templating and such. This means you'll need to get Jekyll up and running in order to view and edit the site on your own machine. Jekyll will handle rendering the pages and compiling Sass, so no need to run `sass --watch` or anything like that.

To get Jekyll running follow these steps:

* Open Terminal and navigate to where your project-leap site folder lives
* Run `bundle install`
* After that finishes, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Go to your browser and load up `localhost:4000/project-leap/`

Way to go, nerd. You should be up and running now!
